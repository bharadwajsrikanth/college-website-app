					<h2>COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING</h2>
					<p> <span style="color:blue;">Bangalore Institute Of technology </span> was a pioneer to introduce  <span style="color:blue;">Computer Science and Engineering as an engineering</span/> branch in Karnataka. 
  It was formed in 1979 and has since been one of the top branches  not only in BIT but also in Karnataka. BIT is above other other institutes is 
  mainly because of this department. It has always got top ranks in the university and has been consistent ever since its establishment.
						 </p>
					<p>Believing strongly in the motto <span style="color:blue;">"Technology for Prosperity"</span> the college has seen phenomenal growth in the last two and a half decades bringing innovation to every road we have traveled.
						Inside this campus the possibilities seem limitless.
						You will find cutting-edge technology, state-of-the-art equipment and minds that push the envelope of theory and experimentation.</p>
 
					<p>There are a number of centres carrying out inter-disciplinary research and many collaborative programmes exist between the college and other institutions, like IISc, N.A.L, etc.
						The chemistry department has been recognized as one of the latest research centres in the state of Karnataka. 
						The college is also a program centre for <span style="color:blue;">IGNOU.</span> Teaching & research work is also amply supported by facilities such as central library with 30000 volumes of text books and reference books, and an <span style="color:blue;">INDUSTRIAL CONSULTANCY AND RESEARCH CENTER. </span>
						Besides this, the institute also offers the facilities like auditorium (1200 seating capacity), 
						seminar hall, co-operative society, canteen, full fledged sports and cultural sections as well as hostels for boys and girls.</p>

					<p>The role of shaping the modern world that is being played by engineers can hardly be exaggerated.Hence,the ultimate aim of any distinguished technical
						education institute should be to promote a multifaced development of the students.Then only,they would be competent enough to fulfill the ensuring demands of the society.</p>

					<p>The core stregth of this institution is the team of dedicated,Well experienced faculty members with relevant discipline expertise.Tn addition,the continuous support and guidance along with immaculate encouragement from the management towards faculty development as well as infrastructure
						enhancement,will certainly lead to achieve the long tern goal of this great institution to impart high quality affordable engineering education to the youth of the country.</p>
